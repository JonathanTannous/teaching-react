# A Repo for teaching others React.

I am using this repo to teach others React without having to go through the burden of project init. Also being used to teach other the basics of git and GitHub.

The skills learned here are directly applicable to the Mr. Math portal frontend development.

## Instructions

- Fork this repo and clone it to your machine
- "npm i" in the terminal to install dependencies
- "npm run dev" in the terminal to run the app in development
- navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view the app
- Fetch (get) fake user data from "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=3"
- Display each user's name and email
- Bonus points if you include a loading indicator until the data is fetched
- Bonus points if you include the user's photo
- Push your results to GitHub

## Skills Practiced

- git & GitHub
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Fetching data with Axios
- Reading and displaying JSON data

A Solution file is included. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS UNTIL YOU ARE FINISHED!!! If you run into issues, please see me first so we can discuss any friction in this project. Don't forget, the purpose of this project is to learn, not to get to the final solution.
